<h2>Avengers:Endgame</h2>
<p>I just can't remember a cinematic experience like the one I just had with #AvengersEndgame. Simply blown away. I feel like that movie was made for every Marvel fan, everywhere.</p>
<h2>Avengers:Infinity War</h2>
<p>I liked #Avengers#Infinity War more than a few other folks I'm talking to after the premiere. It's hugely emotional and very funny but some might find it. I need to sleep on this.</p>
<h2>Spiderman:No Way Home</h2>
<p>Electro, Sandman, Green Goblin, Doc Ock and Sand Man. Yeah I feel like Sinister Six is happening in this movie. Gonna be the final MCU film with him in it. Feels sad but, we seem to be in for an amazing send off.</p>
